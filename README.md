REST API
The object metadata APIs make the power of the award-winning Rijksmuseum website directly accessible to developers. Searching the collection through the API offers a wide range of interesting possibilities, as do the tiled images used to zoom in to close-ups of objects. The JSON-based service is easy to use so you can create an application using the Rijksmuseumâ€™s rich and freely accessible content in no time.


Introduction Information and Data Policy
The Rijksmuseum links individuals with art and history. Information and data play a vital role in making these connections possible. The Rijksmuseum's Information and Data Policy aims to share information and data about our collections with as many people as possible. While we make our information and data as openly available as possible, we also ensure the protection of sensitive and confidential information, such as personal data.

What does the policy cover?
The Information and Data Policy outlines:

How the Rijksmuseum handles information and data related to the collection.
What users are allowed to do with our information and data.
What information and data we share, and the circumstances under which restrictions apply, such as privacy regulations or agreements with other parties.
We adhere to (inter)national standards to facilitate collaboration and the exchange of information. We also use open software formats wherever possible to promote the use of our information and data.

Why an Information and Data Policy?
Since 2011/12, the Rijksmuseum has been sharing information and data through an open data policy, which was expanded in 2024. With the rapid growth of digital technology and the increase in digital research, more information and data about our collection and organisation has become available. The variety of data types has also increased. Our policy explains how we manage this wealth of information and data and make it as accessible as possible. We collaborate with the national and international heritage community, where standardisation, cooperation, and knowledge sharing are increasingly important.

What can you do with our information and data?
According to our policy, much of the information and data on the Rijksmuseum's collection website and through our open data services can be freely used, including for commercial purposes, without needing to request permission. In some cases, however, usage restrictions apply, which are clearly indicated on our collection website.

For much of the information and data on the collection website, you will find a Public Domain or Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Public Domain Dedication under the copyright notice, meaning you can use the material freely This means that the material is either free of copyright, or the Rijksmuseum has waived its rights.
In some cases, copyright does apply. If so, a Creative Commons BY 4.0 (CC BY 4.0) licence is indicated. This allows you to use the material, as long as you acknowledge the Rijksmuseum as the source.
The collection website also contains information and data that are not freely available, such as photographs of objects that are still under copyright. In these cases, the copyright holder is indicated in the copyright notice.
Attribution
We kindly ask that when using our information and data, you credit the Rijksmuseum (and, where possible, our staff) as the original creator, even if this is not required. This acknowledges the efforts of our staff, who work every day to produce new information and data and make it digitally available.
