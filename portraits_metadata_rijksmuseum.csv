Self-portrait as the Apostle Paul,"oil on canvas, 1661","Rembrandt is 55 years old in this self-portrait, and he still looks at himself candidly. Here he assumes the guise of a personage from the Bible, the Apostle Paul. The sword protruding from his cloak and the manuscript in his hands are the apostle’s customary attributes. By using his own face, Rembrandt encouraged the viewer to engage personally with the saint.","https://iiif.micr.io/wqcDn/0,1029,10080,5670/1920,1080/0/default.webp"
Self-portrait,"Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890), oil on cardboard, 1887","Vincent moved to Paris in 1886, after hearing from his brother Theo about the new, colourful style of French painting. Wasting no time, he tried it out in several self-portraits. He did this mostly to avoid having to pay for a model. Using rhythmic brushstrokes in striking colours, he portrayed himself here as a fashionably dressed Parisian.",https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/api/headless/assets/07f4d465-f831-4ca0-9797-2644f037ef07?w=1024&h=1080&useFocusPointForResize=true&format=webp
Portraits of Giuliano and Francesco Giamberti da Sangallo,"Piero di Cosimo (1462–1522), Florence, 1482–1485, oil on panel","This exceptional diptych shows the leading Florentine architect Giuliano da Sangallo and his recently deceased father Francesco, who was an architect as well as a musician. These are among the earliest portraits to characterize their sitters by profession: a pen and compass allude to architecture, the sheet music to music. Both disciplines are based on notions of harmony and proportion.",https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/api/headless/assets/07f4d465-f831-4ca0-9797-2644f037ef07?w=1024&h=1080&useFocusPointForResize=true&format=webp
Portrait of Lysbeth van Duvenvoirde,"Cologne, c. 1430, oil on parchment","‘Long have I yearned for the man who would open his heart.’ With these words, inscribed in Middle Dutch on the S-shaped banderole, Lysbeth van Duvenvoirde expressed her feelings for her husband. She was from a noble Dutch family and married the knight Simon van Adrichem in 1430. In this portrait she is wearing her wedding jewellery: a necklace, five rings, and a belt with little bells.",https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/api/headless/assets/07f4d465-f831-4ca0-9797-2644f037ef07?w=1024&h=1080&useFocusPointForResize=true&format=webp
Portrait of Marie Jeanette de Lange,"Jan Toorop (1858-1928), oil on canvas, 1900","Marie Jeanette de Lange chaired the Vereeniging voor Verbetering van Vrouwenkleding (Association for the Improvement of Women’s Clothing), which championed hygienic, loose-fitting, natural clothing that allowed women greater freedom of movement. In February 1900 she posed at home, dressed comfortably, for Jan Toorop. Using tiny dots of colourful paint, he created a sparkling portrait of a modern woman on the threshold of a new century.",https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/api/headless/assets/07f4d465-f831-4ca0-9797-2644f037ef07?w=1024&h=1080&useFocusPointForResize=true&format=webp
Isabella,"Simon Maris (1873-1935), oil on canvas, c. 1906","In creating this portrait, Maris first took photographs of the young girl as reference material. Thanks to those pictures and other documents in Maris’ archive, we know the girl was about twelve years old when she posed for him. Maris made several portraits of her, some bearing the title Isabella, including this painting. This was possibly not her real name, as models commonly used aliases.",https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/api/headless/assets/07f4d465-f831-4ca0-9797-2644f037ef07?w=1024&h=1080&useFocusPointForResize=true&format=webp
